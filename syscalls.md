# Syscalls in Xous

Syscalls enable communication between processes, as well as communication to the kernel.  These are guaranteed to never change, but new syscalls may be added.

Syscalls may take up to seven `usize`-bit arguments, and may return up to seven `usize`-bit output operands, plus a tag indicating success or failure.

## Syscalls on RISC-V

RISC-V specifies eight registers as `argument` registers: `$a0`-`$a7`.  When performing a syscall, the following convention is used:

| Register | Usage (Calling) |
| -------- | -------------- |
| a0       | Arg 1 |
| a1       | Arg 2 |
| a2       | Arg 3 |
| a3       | Arg 4 |
| a4       | Arg 5 |
| a5       | Arg 6 |
| a6       | Arg 7 |
| a7       | Syscall Number |

When returning from the syscall, these registers have the following meaning:

| Register | Usage (Return) |
| -------- | -------------- |
| a0       | Return type tag |
| a1       | Arg 1 |
| a2       | Arg 2 |
| a3       | Arg 3 |
| a4       | Arg 4 |
| a5       | Arg 5 |
| a6       | Arg 6 |
| a7       | Arg 7 |

Note that this means that there is a hard limit on the number of arguments that can be passed.

## List of syscalls

Actual system calls function names are all prefixed with `sys_`.  However, when referred to generically, omit this prefix.  For example, prefer `client_send` over `sys_client_send`.

Calls that may be made from an Interrupt context begin with `sysi_` (or, more generally,
with interrupts disabled).

/// expired while the server was running, then this function would return
/// a single context containing the PID of the server, and the stack pointer.
///
/// If the child called `client_send()` and the server was ready, then the
/// server process would be run immediately.  If the server then finishes,
/// execution flow is returned to the child process.  If the quantum then
/// expires, this would return two contexts: the server's PID and its stack
/// pointer when it called `client_reply()`, and the child's PID with its
/// current stack pointer.
